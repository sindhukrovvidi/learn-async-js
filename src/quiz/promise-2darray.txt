Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

console.log of sumPromise1 is printed first then console.log of sumPromise2 before the result of sumPromise1 is printed in the output becasue the computation takes time.
So, the computation is done in async manner.
So, output of the sumPromise1 is printed first and then the output of sumPromise2.
